    <p>
        Hey! I'm <strong>Naim</strong>. Coding has changed my world. It's not just about apps.
         Learning to code gave me <i>problem-solving skills</i>
          and a way to communicate with others on a technical level. 
          I can also develop websites and use my coding skills to get a better job.
           And I learned it all at <strong>SoloLearn</strong>
            where they build your self-esteem and keep you motivated.
             Join me in this rewarding journey. You'll have fun, get help, and learn along the way!
